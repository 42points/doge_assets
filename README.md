doge_assets
===========

**Much assets.  Very design.  Wow!**

This is intended to be the master asset respository for DogeCoin.  I'm considering this initial commit as a pre-alpha state and am  open to any and all suggestions for organization.  

Also note that if you're looking for backend resources (wallets, etc.), [ummjackson has you covered](https://github.com/ummjackson/dogecoin-resources).

**A NOTE ON LICENSING**
Github does not provide a Creative Commons option so I have opted for the unlicense.  See LICENSE for details and let me know if you feel there is a better option.  In the meantime, please ensure that any assets you would like to include are freely shareable, either through the public domain or else under the terms of another license.  Include details wherever possible.
